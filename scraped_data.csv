Any diagnosis of a minor critical condition must fulfill the definition together with the Terms and Conditions stated under the heading of that minor critical condition.\n\n### Carcinoma in situ\n\nCarcinoma in situ is defined as a focal autonomous new group of carcinomatous cells which has not yet resulted in the invasion of normal tissue. Invasion means an infiltration and/or active destruction of normal tissue beyond the basement membrane. Diagnosis of carcinoma in situ must be supported by a histopathological report and a positive result of a microscopic examination of fixed tissue, and confirmed by a biopsy result. Clinical diagnosis does not meet this standard.\n\nFor the purpose of this policy, carcinoma in situ is limited only to the following 13 organs:\n\n(1) Cervix Uteri\\*\n\n(2) Uterus\n\n(3) Breast\n\n(4) Vagina\n\n(5) Fallopian Tube\n\n(6) Ovary\\*\\*\n\n(7) Testicles\n\n(8) Colon\n\n(9) Lung\n\n(10) Penis\n\n(11) Rectum\n\n(12) Stomach\n\n(13) Vulva\n\n\\*For carcinoma in situ of cervix uteri, it must be at a grading of not less than CIN III and be positively diagnosed upon the basis of a microscopic examination of fixed tissue from a cone biopsy or colposcopy with cervical biopsy.\n\n\\*\\*For carcinoma in situ of ovary, the tumors should be capsule intact, with no tumor on the ovarian surface, classified as T1aN0M0, T1bN0M0 (TMN classification) or FIGO 1A, FIGO 1B (The Federation Internationale de Gynecologie et d’Obstetrique).\n\nIn order to qualify for a benefit under this condition for the second time, the carcinoma in situ of the second claim must be a carcinoma in situ of the organs that is different from the organ of the first claim for which benefit has been paid.\n\nFor the avoidance of doubt, for those organs with both left and right component (including but not limited to breast, ear, eye, fallopian tube, kidney, lung, ovary and testicle), the left component and right component of the organ **shall be considered as one and the same organ**.\n\n### Early Stage Cancer of Prostate\n\nA prostate malignant tumor which is histologically classified as T1a, T1b, T1c according to the TNM classification system or another equivalent classification, and having a Gleason score below 7. The diagnosis must be based on histopathological features and confirmed by a specialist. Pre-malignant lesions and conditions, unless listed above, are excluded.\n\n### Early Stage of Urinary/ Bladder Cancer\n\nBladder cancer which is histologically described using TNM classification as T1N0M0 as well as papillary micro-carcinoma of Bladder. Diagnosis must be supported by histopathology report.\n\n### Early Stage of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia\n\nChronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) RAI Stage 1 or 2. RAI stage CLL 0 or lower is excluded.\n\n### Insertion of Pacemaker or Defibrillator\n\nThe undergoing of insertion of a permanent cardiac pacemaker or a cardiac defibrillator to correct serious cardiac arrhythmia which cannot be treated via other methods. The insertion of the cardiac pacemaker or cardiac defibrillator must be certified to be medically necessary by a specialist in cardiology and/or by our medical director or authorized medical consultant, according to our guidelines.\n\n### Angioplasty and Other Invasive Treatments for Coronary Artery Disease\n\nThe actual undergoing of balloon angioplasty, atherectomy, or laser treatment to correct narrowing in major coronary arteries (defined as being greater than 50% stenosis in two or more major coronary arteries; or being greater than 75% stenosis in one or more major coronary artery by angiogram). The treatment must be considered medically necessary by a specialist and/or by our medical director or authorized medical consultant, according to our guidelines, either to relieve exercise limiting symptomatology which is not responding adequately to medical therapy or in order to achieve a prognostic benefit. For purposes of this definition, “major coronary artery” refers to any of the left main stem artery, left anterior descending artery, circumflex artery and right coronary artery (but not including their branches).\n\nIn order to qualify for a benefit under this condition, there must be:\n\n(1) History of symptoms which are sufficiently severe to indicate that the Life Insured’s future level of exercise tolerance would be restricted, despite medications, to a minimal level without percutaneous intervention; and\n\n(2) Medical evidence including all of the following:\n\n2.1 Report from attending specialist; and\n\n2.2 Evidence of significant and relevant ECG changes (ST segment depression of 2 millimeters or more); and\n\n2.3 Angiographic evidence to confirm the location and degree of stenosis in major coronary artery.\n\n### Aortic Aneurysm\n\nThe diagnosis of a large abdominal or thoracic aortic aneurysm as evidenced by appropriate imaging technique. The aorta must be enlarged greater than 50 mm in diameter and the diagnosis must be confirmed by a specialist in cardiology and/or by our medical director or authorized medical consultant, according to our guidelines. For this definition, aorta means the thoracic and abdominal aorta but not its branches.\n\n### Keyhole Coronary Bypass Surgery\n\nThe undergoing for the first time for the correction of the narrowing or blockage of one or more coronary arteries with bypass grafts via ""Keyhole"" surgery.

You may use your Visa or Mastercard credit card to avail. **Please note that the credit card you should use must be under your name**.\n\nWhat You Need to Know\n\nHow is critical illness plan different from HMO?\n\nHMOs or Health Maintenance Organizations offer access to doctors within their network, as well as comprehensive and customizable healthcare insurance. The plans are usually limited to a certain amount and depending on the plan, may not be enough to cover treatments for critical illnesses.\n\nMeanwhile, critical illness plans, like **Health Start Lite**, provide an extra cover of protection for serious illnesses, and can help you in fulfilling other needs since it provides a lump sum amount when a covered illness or condition happens. For instance, if you become unable to work because of a critical condition, the critical illness plan payout can be used to not only pay for your treatment but also, fund your recurring bills such as utilities, groceries, and other living expenses.\n\nSo if you already have an HMO, having a critical illness plan will complement your health protection. It ensures your lifestyle remains normal especially since a critical illness might render you unable to work.\n\nWhat types of cancer are covered in this plan?\n\nFor this plan, cancer is defined as the first unequivocal diagnosis of any malignant tumor characterized by the uncontrolled growth of malignant cells and invasion of tissue, and positively diagnosed with histological confirmation by a specialist and/or by AXA’s medical director or authorized medical consultant.\n\nThis also includes benefit for:\n\nLeukemia, malignant lymphoma, Hodgkin’s Disease, malignant bone marrow disorders, metastatic skin cancer, and breast carcinoma in situ with subsequent radical mastectomy and radiotherapy\n\nClick [here](https://new-axa-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/axa-com-ph%2F29ac370f-9f8b-4bcc-b9a7-e7231f9db0b5_final+definitions+of+major+critical+conditions+may8.pdf) to view the full definitions, coverage, and exclusions of the major critical conditions covered in this plan.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these definitions from time to time as we deem necessary, subject to proper notice upon approval of the Insurance Commission.\n\nHow many and what minor illnesses are covered in this plan?\n\nThere are nine (9) minor critical conditions that are covered in this plan:\n\n(1) Carcinoma in situ\n\n(2) Early stage cancer of prostate\n\n(3) Early stage of urinary/bladder cancer\n\n(4) Early stage of chronic lymphocytic leukemia\n\n(5) Insertion of pacemaker or defibrillator\n\n(6) Angioplasty and other invasive treatments for coronary artery disease\n\n(7) Aortic aneurysm\n\n(8) Keyhole coronary bypass surgery\n\n(9) Cerebral shunt insertion\n\nClick [here](https://new-axa-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/axa-com-ph%2Fa1a85f52-fc6d-42c3-be19-84b4a46ab67b_final+definitions+of+minor+critical+conditions+may8.pdf) to view the full definitions, coverage, and exclusions of the minor critical conditions covered in this plan.\n\nWe reserve the right to change these definitions from time to time as we deem necessary, subject to proper notice upon approval of the Insurance Commission.\n\nAre there any exclusions that I need to know?\n\nThere are several exclusions from the coverage that you should take note of.

Whose signs or symptoms are evident, or should have been evident to the Insured, even if the Insured did not seek medical advice, consultation or treatment for it prior to the effective date or the date of last reinstatement, if any.\n\nFor how long will I be covered?\n\nYour coverage will be for one (1) year. Should you wish to remain covered, make sure you renew your plan annually to continue enjoying the same coverage until you are 75 years of age. Also do note that you must NOT have encountered any covered minor or major condition within 60 days following the later of the policy effective date, or last reinstatement date, otherwise, this plan’s benefit won’t be payable.\n\nOn the other hand, in case of your untimely demise following your policy effective date, 100% of your life insurance benefit less any benefits paid within the same policy year, will be given to your beneficiary.\n\nCan I purchase this for someone else?\n\nHealth Start Lite is available for personal purchase only.

For policies with a minor as the insured.\n\nFrequently Asked Questions\n\n## Why should I get a critical illness plan?\n\nCritical illness, whether in its pre-early stage, late-stage, or potential recurrence can cause a lot of worries, such as the inability to work resulting to income loss, financial stress related to treatment and medication costs, and daily living expenses. That’s why it’s important to have a reliable protection plan that can look after your well-being, no matter what stage of critical illness you may be in.\n\nFor filing of critical illness claim, here is the [Claims Requirements](https://www.axa.com.ph/self-service?type=claims).\n\n.\n\n## Why should I get Health Max Elite and how is it different from other critical illness plans in the market?\n\nCommon critical illness plans would provide lump sum cash upon diagnosis of their covered conditions. While standard plans may provide a payout of 1x to 6x, Health Max Elite stands out by offering up to 9x of your claim benefits, depending on the severity of your illness. It also has the most extensive range of coverage for up to 156 critical conditions. Get immediate assistance as well for health emergencies that require ICU confinement and life-saving surgeries with the Critical Care Assistance benefit, the first-of-its-kind on the market.\xa0 Moreover, the Pre-Early Conditions Benefit included in this plan allows you to make claims for conditions typically not covered by other critical illness insurance plans.\n\n## I have an existing HMO. How is Health Max Elite different from that?\n\nHMOs offer access to doctors within their network and provide comprehensive and customizable healthcare insurance coverage to their customers. These plans are usually limited to a certain amount, and depending on the coverage, they may not be enough to cover treatments, especially for major critical illnesses. Meanwhile, Health Max Elite provides superior protection for severe ailments and can help you fulfill other needs since it provides a lump sum amount when you’re diagnosed with a covered critical condition. For instance, if you become unable to work due to a medical issue, the plan’s payout can be used not only to finance your treatment, but also to fund your recurring bills such as utilities, groceries, and other living expenses.\n\nSo, if you already have an HMO, having a critical illness plan will complement and even boost your health protection. It ensures your lifestyle won’t be affected, which is particularly important as a critical illness can hinder your ability to work.\n\n## How soon can I claim from the plan?\n\nHealth Max Elite has a waiting period of 60 days from the policy’s effective date or last reinstatement date before any claim can be made on any of the product benefits. If you make a 2nd to 4th major condition claims for cancer, stroke, or heart attack, there’s a waiting period of 2 years between claims and 3 years for persistent cancer or metastatic cancer conditions.\n\n## How many times can I claim?\n\nHealth Max Elite pays the first major critical condition claim for the covered 77 major critical conditions and pays 100% of your sum insured on the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th major critical condition claims for cancer, stroke, and heart attack.\n\nFor the 73 minor conditions covered such as carcinoma in situ, chronic kidney impairment, and angioplasty, the plan pays 20% of the sum insured up to 2x for the duration of the policy. All claims are subject to the applicable waiting period.\n\nSEE MORE FAQs\n\nExplore more products\n\n[link_accessibility_temp](https://www.axa.com.ph/products/health-and-critical-illness/health-max-elite)\n\nCRITICAL ILLNESS PLAN\n\n## Health Max\u200b\n\nA comprehensive critical illness plan for 56 major and 18 minor conditions, with up to ₱10 million coverage until age 100.\n\n[KNOW MORE](https://www.axa.com.ph/products/health-and-critical-illness/health-max)\n\nCRITICAL ILLNESS PLAN\n\n## Health Start\n\nA critical illness plan for yourself and your loved ones against the top 3 critical illnesses and its early-stage conditions for as low as ₱1,500 per month.\n\n[KNOW MORE](https://www.axa.com.ph/products/health-and-critical-illness/health-start)\n\nCRITICAL ILLNESS PLAN\n\n## Health Start Lite\n\nAffordable online critical illness insurance plan against the top 3 critical illnesses–cancer, stroke, and heart attack for as low as ₱535 per month.\n\n[KNOW MORE](https://www.axa.com.ph/healthstartlite)\n\nTo offer you a better experience, this site uses cookies, including those of third parties.
